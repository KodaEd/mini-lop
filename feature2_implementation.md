I copied the seed file into the crash folder and just printed an alert out. 

the filename is the same like feat1 where filename is based on how many files in the folder.

I was not sure  if we need to put it into the seedqueue. It makes sense why we should cause it allows us to trim and find more crashes. But it doesnt give unique crashes.
